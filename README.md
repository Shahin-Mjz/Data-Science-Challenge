# Data Science Challenge

- **Project scenario**
A Data Science Coding Competition project working with a real-world dataset to build a prediction or classification model. Participants used Python and Jupyter Notebook to tackle the problem, focusing on data manipulation, feature 
engineering, and model evaluation. The competition provided an opportunity for learners to apply their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as gain experience in machine learning algorithms and data visualization 
techniques.
  
- **Summary**
Optimized data for balance, removed redundancy, and enhanced predictive power using advanced techniques. Achieved project objectives seamlessly.

- **Solution**
In this project, I addressed data imbalances by configuring predictors to 'balanced' mode. Identified and removed redundant features using Gradient Boosting Classifier for feature selection. Applied One-Hot encoding to convert nominal to numerical data. Achieved optimal model performance through Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search. Overall, successfully streamlined the dataset and achieved project objectives.

- **Approach**
In executing the project, I initiated with comprehensive data exploration, addressing imbalances by configuring 'balanced' predictors. Identified and removed redundant features through Gradient Boosting Classifier, applied One-Hot encoding for nominal data, and conducted feature selection. Refined the model via Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search, ensuring optimal performance and successful project completion.
